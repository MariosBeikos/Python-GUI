# Python-GUI
This is a gui created in Python using the library "tkinter" among others. Its purpose is the geographical transformation of points while also the user can create a figure or export the transformed points.
Note: This is just a project for my personal growth, and to get acquainted with the "tkinter" library. It most certnainly is not to be considered as professional work :)
